Repository: [Challenge-Problems](https://github.com/bdzyubak/Challenge-Problems)


## Purpose:

This repository contains various programming challenge problems I had done over the years. Some are based on websites 
such as Hacker rank, others from interviews I've had. There are also a few simple DL/ML network implementations 
from scratch. Anyone is welcome to try the challenge problems themselves.


## Repository Organization 

Many, challenges have a solved version, and a matching "_practice" file which contains function templates 
and unit tests to determine if the implementation is successful. These can be used as a refresher. Changes to templates 
or reference implementations are only meant to be committed to the source if they are much more elegant. 
The main planned updates are more challenges!

## Installation

The majority of the code should work on any system with Python 3. Code contained in folders with dependency names like 
Tensorflow, Pytorch, or pandas will require a roughly 2024 version of that dependency.
